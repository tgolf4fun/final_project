               <p>"My daughter had been dancing for years before we discovers D&G. She had a solid foundation from two different studios, but
                something was missing, something I could not quite put my finger on. I will get to what that was later in this story;) It
                was the summer of 2014, and we discovered D&G's summer camp, "Monsters"! The summer show that was presented after just two
                weeks of camp blew my mind!! How could Jeffie Lou get that many young dancers to pull off a show of that caliber with such
                little time??? We were sold!! I could not wait to see how she nurtured the dancers that were actually in her yearly company.
                Needless to say that first year with the studio blew my mind!! My daughter was challenged, and inspired. She was home!! I
                finally discovered what was missing. Each dancer is encouraged to bring their own unique style into each movement, which
                intern is a clear reflection of how confident these dancers are on stage and off!! This is why the dancers are beyond excited
                to come to class ready to work. D&G has heart, family, love, and teachers who mentor each child as if they were their own.
                Jeffie Lou, is that head "coach" that teaches them the foundations for a successful life including the importance of strong
                work ethic, respect for the craft and most of all respect for each other. At D&G they lift each other up, encourage each other
                to be brave, and take risks. This is one dance family we are truly proud to be a part of......."

                   daughter has become a strong dancer, gained confidence, and made true friendships at D&G that we will cherish forever! We

                   challenged.... No doubt about it; we're lucky to have D&G in our community!....."
